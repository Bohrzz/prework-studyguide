# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation making this webpage was to compile the information I learned in the prework so I could refer to it easily during the coding bootcamp. I learned the basics of HTML,CSS,GIT and Java script during the prework and I can review the information that i have compiled easilly by accessing this website while I undertake the journey of becoming a web devloper.
